# Deep_Learning_Challenge
I completed this deep learning challenge by using google colab with assistance from chat gpt and collab's built in AI

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a model capable of determining if Alphabet soup should fund applicants. 

## Process
I prepared this data by doing following:
    
+ **Dropped  uneeded columns**
+ **Removed null values**
+ **Made the data numeric**

I then took the following steps to train my model:

+ **Set a random state**
+ **Added hidden layers**
+ **Set epochs**

## Results
Unfortunetly, I was not able to reach 75% accuracy. Here is a breakdown of each attempt's accuracy:

+ **Original attempt**: 73.29% accuracy, 55.5% loss
+ **First optimized attempt**: 73.20% accuracy, 57.70% loss
+ **Second optimized attempt**: 72.78% accuracy, 56.96% loss
+ **Third optimized attempt**: 72.97% accuracy, 56.18% loss


Based on these results, I would not recommend Alphabet to use this model.
